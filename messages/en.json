    "description": "Hello again. I am Sajad Mahdian, born in 1994. After my bachelor's degree, I entered the professional field and have been developing web-based applications professionally since 2018. Most of my experience is in working with the React library. In fact, I have developed most of the different dashboards. But this book does not mean that I do not work with other libraries and do not have experience in using them, but rather that I have more experience in developing dashboards. I am interested in using new technologies in my field.",
